To use this AMD module , we have to use 
### require.js 
library.


<hr>


<hr>



### if you see the index.html , we had before on update some ,

### but in AMD module , we are doing this writing , in after JS
and the reason is
when you were using plain vanilla , everything all the JavaScript files were pulled in with the Dom ,
and they were all in  one context in the browser.
So on click , can see the updates sum .


But if you run this code on click update some ,
now update some is in on AMD module , which will not be visible to the context of the broswer.

And this code will not work.
So that is why we will remove this from here.
